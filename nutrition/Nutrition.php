                <span>On off days, do not take the
                    carbohydrate and protein powder
                    shake, instead, eat a meal, if it's a low
                    carb day, just protein and veggies, if its
                    high carb day, use carbs with the same
                    macros as the post workout shake.</span><hr>
                <span>Chicken is measured after cooking, and
                    also meat. Rice is measured after
                    cooking</span><hr>
                <span>First 3 weeks no cheat meals. Then
                    cheat every 3rd high carb day.</span><hr>
                <span>You can have 2 squares of dark
                    chocolate a day, 75% by lindt.</span><hr>
                <span>Avoid farmed fish such as tilapia or
                    farmed salmon, try and find haddock
                    fish instead!</span><hr>
                <span>Use lots of herbs and spices when
                    cooking any meal to add flavor and also
                    to make use of their anti-oxidants and
                    anti-inflammatory effects.</span><hr>
                <span>Add kale, spinach, or other greens in
                    shakes/smoothies to add fiber and
                    increase nutrition.</span><hr>
                <span style="color: red;">You will do 1 high carb day and then the
                    prescribed amount of low carb days. It
                    has nothing to do with the week, you
                    just do 1 high, and the number of low. If
                    you do not lose fat fast enough, add an
                    extra low day.</span>
